### Flow + Routing

- Open song reader after download
- embed yt-dlp
- Remove .mp3 from filename display so it can't be changed
- Tie filename to title
- Infer title & artist from filename
- Open all downloaded files from a playlist in song reader
- Figure out lazy/sequential loading on playlist viewer so it loads faster
- Try a virtual list for playlist viewer

- ~~Player exists across tabs~~
- ~~Top level router~~
- ~~After DL, get list of items, queue them into metadata viewer.~~
- ~~Songs get uploader set as album on download~~
- ~~Filename can be changed in metadata viewer~~
- ~~Refresh file list on filename change~~
